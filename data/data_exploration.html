The wealthy Countess of Rothes takes command of the lifeboat as her maid, Roberta Maioni, clutches a photograph of her beau, Jack Phillips, the ship's radio operator who stayed aboard ship to send out the world's first SOS signal.

Educated by Jesuits, he was an excellent pupil but one quickly enraged by dogma. An early rift with his father&mdash;who wished him to study law&mdash;led to his choice of letters as a career. Insinuating himself into court circles, he became notorious for lampoons on leading notables and was twice imprisoned in the Bastille.By his mid-thirties his literary activities precipitated a four-year exile in England where he won the praise of Swift and Pope for his political tracts. His publication, three years later in France, ofLettres philosophiques sur les Anglais(1733)&mdash;an attack on French Church and State&mdash;forced him to flee again. For twenty years Voltaire lived chiefly away from Paris. In this, his most prolific period, he wrote such satirical tales as &ldquo;Zadig&rdquo; (1747) and &ldquo;Candide&rdquo; (1759). His old age at Ferney, outside Geneva, was made bright by his adopted daughter, &ldquo;Belle et Bonne,&rdquo; and marked by his intercessions in behalf of victims of political injustice.

They meet on a dark night, their individual pain foremost in their minds, and as they begin to know each other, they begin to heal each other.Eva is a strong, lovely woman, a normal woman trying to live the best life she can on her own terms. Ben is a gorgeous mountain of a man, whose work for his club is dark but who manages to keep some light and love to share with the right woman. If ever he should meet her. Trust comes dear to Ben; he takes a huge risk to trust anyone, as he well knows. To let his guard down is itself an act of love for him.The world of Tippitt, like so many real small towns, is populated with interesting characters--some of them quirky, some of them hilarious, some of them mysterious, and some who are just regular people.There is heart-fluttering romance, smokin' hot sex, intrigue, danger and drama--and surprise--in a tight plot that snares Ben and Eva and threatens the tenuous peace they've found with each other.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.The Critics RaveThe New York Times says that his &#x22;roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography.&#x22; Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that &#x22;After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man.&#x22;NPR calls his work &#x22;adventurous and enormously engrossing...&#x22; and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: &#x22;If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker.&#x22;The Story Teller's StoryAs a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.Explosive Page-Turning AdventuresThe exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.\nIn recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing &#x22;seminars.&#x22; James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)": {"frequency": 122, "value": "About James ..."}, "&#x22;The journey Kate and Ryke take&#xa0;is a powerful, engaging and sometimes hot look into marriage.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time.

Most of us have read Mark Twain's stories about two young boys and their life in Hannibal, Missouri by the time we are in the sixth grade. What a rare treat it was for me to meet them again when I am old and gray. Andrew Joyce presented me with the chance of seeing two old friends and sharing their new lives.Redemption opens as Tom and Huck are joining the Civil War to fight for the South they so love. It doesn't take long for them to realize the battlefield is not where they want to be and so starts the adult adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. They desert the army and head out West to see San Francisco. When they arrive, Tom makes plans to take a boat to China. Huck decides on wandering around until he finds a place to call home. Tom never makes it to China but does find a life for himself in Hawaii. Huck becomes a sheriff in several different towns before settling down in Redemption. Each have their own exciting activities before they once again meet up and share the life of the Wild West together, twelve years later. &#xa0;Andrew Joyce is a genius in bringing two beloved characters back to life. &#xa0;Redemption: The Further Adventures of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer is destined to be a five star top seller. I was thrilled to have the opportunity of reuniting with two well-loved characters from my youth. &#xa0;I loved Tom and Huck then and I love them even more today as written about by the brilliant Andrew Joyce.

Most publishers are afraid\n to publicly announce and discuss their negative reviews, but since I\nstand behind my product and believe in its quality I will walk you\nthrough the negative reviews and together we shall see what they have to\n say. This list will be updated daily with the usernames of those\n''negative reviewers'', their motives to do that and parts of the book\nthat prove them wrong.The first reviewer to fall in this category is&#xa0; J, L.Yu (arrow2fast)Arrow2fast goes a bit more personal and mostly tries to offend me. She claims she read only the first chapter of Money Flow and then returned it for a refund, because it was poorly edited. The funny thing about that is that THE ENTIRE first chapter is available for free if you use the Amazon ''Look Inside'' option, so Arrow2fast, why did you buy my book if you didn't like the first chapter in the first place? So please use the Look Inside option, check the first chapter and if it's that poorly written as Arrow2fast claims just don't buy the book.But she doesn't stop there. Arrow2fast claims that all my reviews are fake, because they were not Amazon verified. To clear up the record, Arrow2fast, I've been selling paperbacks in a local sea resort all summer, both on a stand and inside hotels through their receptionists. And when the summer season was over I published my books online on October 1st. So I had&#xa0; a big fanbase before I even joined Amazon and people have been reading my books long before they were even published here.Arrow2fast also claims my characters were stupid adolescents. Well, Money Flow is designed as ''stream of consciousness''. The main character is a teenager and you see the world through his eyes. And most of the older audience do not like to hear the rants of younger people(mostly rebels) and are not interested to dive deep in their psychology, so I'm guessing Arrow2fast is an old person, who insults modern world teenagers on a regular basis.Next thing Arrow2fast claims is that I ''identify myself with the main character'' since I named him after myself..

A hot-air balloon carrying five passengers and a dog escapes from Richmond, Va., during the American Civil War. It is blown off course and deposited near an obscure island.

But these concerns melt away after the first 100 pages of this volume. Briggs's descriptions are crisper and the dialogue is sharper, with fewer &#x22;shall's,&#x22; &#x22;shan't's&#x22; and &#x22;I say!'s&#x22; than the Garnett, Maude, or Edmonds translations, leaving readers free to enjoy the rich and complex plot, vivid characters and profound insights into war and the nature of power. There are some awkward spots: Briggs claims his earthy rendering of soldierly banter is more realistic than earlier, genteel translators', but it reads distractingly stagy: &#x22;Give 'im a right thumpin', we did.&#x22; It's also a shame to have lost Tolstoy's use of French, not only in the mouths of his characters, but also in the essays, as when he plays with Napoleon's famous &#x22;sublime to the ridiculous&#x22; quote.

Keeping Christ and his teachings as the center of our lives and following the path chosen by him for us, while trusting his plans for us, will smooth out our lives and help us to lead a joyous and blessed life.

Jacobs' single work, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, published in 1861 under the pseudonym &#34;Linda Brent&#34;, was one of the first autobiographical narratives about the struggle for freedom by female slaves and an account of the sexual harassment and abuse they endured. The narrative was designed to appeal to middle class white Christian women in the North, focusing on the impact of slavery on women's chastity and sexual virtues. Christian women could perceive how slavery was a temptation to masculine lusts and vice as well as to womanly virtues. Jacobs criticized the religion of the Southern United States as being un-Christian and as emphasizing the value of money (&#34;If I am going to hell, bury my money with me,&#34; says a particularly brutal and uneducated slaveholder). She described another slaveholder with, &#34;He boasted the name and standing of a Christian, though Satan never had a truer follower.&#34; Jacobs argued that these men were not exceptions to the general rule. Much of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl was devoted to the Jacobs's struggle to free her two children after she escaped. Before that, Harriet spent seven years hiding in a tiny space built into her grandmother's barn to see and hear the voices of her children. Jacobs changed the names of all characters in the novel, including her own, to conceal their true identities. The villainous slave owner &#34;Dr. Flint&#34; was based on Jacobs's former master, Dr. James Norcom.

Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.The Critics RaveThe New York Times says that his &#x22;roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography.&quot; Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that &quot;After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man.&quot;NPR calls his work &quot;adventurous and enormously engrossing...&quot; and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: &quot;If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker.&quot;The Story Teller's StoryAs a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.Explosive Page-Turning AdventuresThe exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.\nIn recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing &#x22;seminars.&#x22; James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)": {"frequency": 301, "value": "About James ..."}, "Praise for Mark Dawson'A brilliant debut novel from a very promising writer.'

The story was written while the author served as writer in residence for the Booktrust an independent UK-wide charity dedicated to encouraging people of all ages and cultures to enjoy books. The New World tells of Viola's journey to the New World, brilliantly capturing the hope and fear of settlers in search of a new life. \n \nPatrick Ness told Amazon exclusively that he wrote it &#x22;as a huge and deeply-felt thank you to readers. I've had so many questions about Viola and what her life was like before that I couldn't resist the opportunity to reveal just a little bit extra. I knew these things - they're vitally important to her as a character, even if they're not directly in the novels - so it felt like a secret trip I could take readers on. The challenge was to make it work on its own, too, so anyone could read it. That was really, really good fun, and I hope the final result is an exciting one.&#x22;\n \nThe New World can be read before or after the trilogy &#x2013; and some readers may choose to do both. The story works as a standalone piece, but readers already familiar with The Knife of Never Letting Go will learn more about Viola&#x2019;s life and the events leading to her arrival and first encounter with Todd, while newcomers to the trilogy will discover a white-knuckle ride of an introduction to the series.

Although accepting of his status as a great innovator in the struggle against racism, violence, and, just then, colonialism, Gandhi feared that enthusiasm for his ideas tended to exceed a deeper understanding. He says that he was after truth rooted in devotion to God and attributed the turning points, successes, and challenges in his life to the will of God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices (he called himself a fruitarian), celibacy, andahimsa, a life without violence. It is in this sense that he calls his bookThe Story of My Experiments with Truth, offering it also as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps. A reader expecting a complete accounting of his actions, however, will be sorely disappointed.Although Gandhi presents his episodes chronologically, he happily leaves wide gaps, such as the entiresatyagrahastruggle in South Africa, for which he refers the reader to another of his books. And writing for his contemporaries, he takes it for granted that the reader is familiar with the major events of his life and of the political milieu of early 20th-century India. For the objective story, try Yogesh Chadha'sGandhi: A Life. For the inner world of a man held as a criminal by the British, a hero by Muslims, and a holy man by Hindus, look no further than these experiments.--Brian Bruya": {"frequency": 98, "value": "Gandhi's ..."}, "Jane Harvey-Berrick has written a number of contemporary romances for adults.

This 22-year-old single mother of one is the hottest new writers to enter the literary game (urban fiction genre) in a long time. She has a writing style all her own. Though it maybe true, ''There's nothing new under the sun,'' nobody can quite write a story like Keisha Ervin. She is destined to take the literary world by storm and breathe new life into the urban fiction market. Growing up, she received numerous accolades and awards for her writing skills. Keisha has been honing her skills and practicing her art since childhood. However, by the time she reached her turbulent adolescent years, fate interceded, altering her childhood dreams. At the ripe old age of 18-years-old, Ms. Ervin became a casualty of teen pregnancy. Her literary career would be a dream deferred. Refusing to become a victim of circumstance, Ms. Ervin was forced to buckle down and re-analyze the direction in which her life was going. Accepting motherhood as a blessing in disguise instead of a curse, she was forced to mature. Realizing she had another life depending upon her for survival, she cleaned up her act, severing her street ties and making the successful transition to motherhood and author.  Hailing from the Midwest, St. Louis, MO to be exact, Keisha Ervin is determined to bring more long deserved recognition to her birthplace just as rappers Nelly, The St. Lunatics and Chingy have done.

When the author accidentally discovers that running puts his demons at bay better than top-shelf bourbon, he begins to shed his old life and becomes something he never wanted to be: a runner, an ultra-distance runner at that. If running is a substitute addiction, Shubaly says, it's &#x22;the dreariest, most painful, least thrilling addiction I have ever experienced.&#x22; The charms of Shubaly's writing are many: his adoring metaphors for drinking reveal it as his true unrequited love; his self-examination has Thoreau-like depth; and his exposition transforms the pedestrian into the sublime.

Placing his hand on the small of her back, he urged her toward the staircase.Elizabeth looked up at him, her protest poised on the tip of her tongue when she saw the lust in his eyes. But that wasn't what gave her pause; it was the glimmer of satisfaction in making her wary and nervous.By God, heknewshe wasn't about to just let him&#xa0;have his way with her. Certainly not before they married. So what was his game?&quot;And is that where you hope to seduce me?&quot; Her parents would be appalled had they heard her.

If I am to court and marry you in such unfashionable haste, I would like some assurance that you and I suit when it comes to the intimacies of the marriage bed.&quot;At his words, lust in its most pure form accosted her. Parts of her went soft while other parts became rigid, pinpoints of pleasure to come.No. No. No. There would be no pleasure of any sort. Not for her and definitely none for the viscount.&quot;So you would like us to have marital relations outside the sanctity of marriage?&quot; she asked in a voice she barely recognized.&#xa0;&quot;You've been so skittish of late. If I hadn't already kissed you, I think you didn't like to be touched.

But on his face, she glimpsed the barest hint of smile.So that was how he thought to get around marrying her. He thought she'd cry off, refusing to enter his philistine game of sampling the goods.For several long seconds, Elizabeth said nothing, allowing him to believe she was grappling in indecision. His hand released its grasp on the handle of the door and he straightened as if ready to claim victory.&quot;Very well, if that's what it will take to ease your mind--ease both our minds--let us proceed. But I must have your assurance that once we've established that we suit, um, in that way, we will immediately announce our betrothal and set a wedding date.&quot;Elizabeth took great satisfaction in watching Lord Creswell's entire form stiffen and his hand still in mid-air. Slowly, he angled his head over his shoulder to regard her, incredulity flashing briefly in the&#xa0; blue-green depths of his eyes. &quot;You are in agreement?&quot;Feigning the stalwartness of that of a virgin about to be sacrificed for the good of God and country, Elizabeth gave a tremulous but firm nod.&quot;And if we do not suit, what then?&quot;Did his voice sound a mite strained?&quot;I have a feeling we shall suit very well.&quot; She gave him a slow smile. &quot;Shall we proceed, my lord?&quot;": {"frequency": 297, "value": "Excerpt &#169; All ..."}, "Thanks for reading, Foxxx Club! &#xa0;": {"frequency": 93, "value": "Thanks for ..."}, "&#x22;It is rare that a book can elicit that much emotion so early in the story.

I started my writing career by writing non-fiction and wrote two books about health and fitness (I am a trained fitness teacher). While writing these books, I discovered how much I loved the actual writing process. My then editor gave me the idea to write a fun novel based on my experiences as a diplomat&#x2019;s wife. This became my debut novel, &#x2018;Diplomatic Incidents&#x2019; (the e-book version is called &#x2018;Duty Free&#x2019;), published in 2001. I wrote three further novels, &#x2018;European Affairs&#x2019; (now as an e-book with the title &#x2018;Villa Caramel&#x2019;), &#x2018;Fresh Powder&#x2019; (2006) and &#x2018;Finding Margo&#x2019;(2007). The latter two were published by New Island Books in Dublin. In 2010, when the publishing industry started to decline, I broke away from both publisher and agent and e-published my backlist, along with two novels that were with my agent for submission. Since then I have written and e-published four further novels and, as a result, now have ten books out there in the e-book market worldwide.

Using the visually irresistible printing techniques popularized by the &#x22;Eyewitness&#x22; series, these two books, when prominently displayed, will probably attract more impulse readers than some of the dustier editions. But do they accomplish their stated aim? Direct textual illustration is plentiful, lively, and useful. The reproductions of prints, photographs, and maps that pepper each page and are intended to enhance readers' grasp of the times, however, are a mixed success. There is a sameness to them and an arbitrary feel to their use. Pirate buffs will find Treasure Island's variety of ship drawings, details of sailing minutiae, and photographs of pieces of eight or guns and swords quite satisfying. Verne's work is less enhanced by its graphics. This episodic travelogue would be best served by lots of clear maps with the route well marked. But the few maps shown are so small that the legends are unreadable and country and city names are blurred. Limitations aside, the initial appeal of this fresh approach may serve to attract some new readers to these enduring stories that have managed without any help for this long.?Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, ILCopyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.": {"frequency": 207, "value": "Grade 6 Up?To most ..."}, "Grade 4-8-The perennial fascination with Frances Hodgeson Burnett's classic story has made it a vehicle for a variety of adaptations. This audio presentation by the Saint Charles Players is an unsuccessful attempt to make the story into a radio-style version.

Sound effects are helpful and the musical interludes pleasant, but overall this offering lacks dramatic intensity. The tapes must be played on a stereo player or part of the story can't be heard.

William Hope reads leisurely  but with feeling, offering listeners the illusion that the  author is speaking directly to them. The abridgements are not  substantive, so listeners will feel that they have become  acquainted with the complexities of a text that is both orderly  and sprinkled with irony and other literary devices. The  chapters are tastefully set off by musical interludes that  complement Thoreau's own rhythms. Not only is this an excellent  alternative for students assigned to read the text that is often  offered in tiny print without benefit of margins, but it is also  possible to suggest this to thoughtful teens who are seeking an  intellectually engaging listening experience for their personal  enjoyment. Hope's pacing invites readers with minimal skills to  accompany their print foray with his narration.

But though they take on some of the physical characteristics of the race they are trading with, the Kindred gene always ensures three things: physical prowess, extremely large and muscular body structure, and undying loyalty to the female of their choice.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Beast Kindredcome from Rageron--a jungle planet full of beautiful but deadly flora and fauna. They have dark hair, golden eyes, and hot tempers but their most defining characteristic is the mating fist. The mating fist is an area at the base of the Beast Kindred's shaft which engages fully only during bonding sex with his chosen mate. This ensures sex that is both tantric and multiorgasmic for both partners.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Blood Kindredare blond with pale blue eyes and come from Tranq Prime where ice, snow, and arctic-like temperatures are the norm. They have a set of double fangs located where a human's canine teeth would be. These fangs do not develop fully or become sharp enough to pierce flesh until a Blood Kindred is with a woman he wishes to mate and bond with.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Twin Kindredcome from Twin Moons--a world of vast, stormy oceans dotted with craggy but beautiful islands. True to their namesake, Twin Kindred always come in pairs. The brothers are not identical, however. There is always a light twin and a dark twin. These labels refer not just to skin, hair, and eye coloring but to the twin's moods and perceptions of the world. The dark twin in the pair is usually more moody and withdrawn while the light twin takes a substantially brighter view of life.&#xA0;&#xA0;In all their years of travel the Kindred have come across only three worlds with species close enough to their own to initiate a trade.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Earth is the fourth.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; After saving the Earth from the ravaging attack of the Scourge (actually a genetic trade gone wrong, a fact which most of the Kindred are unaware of) the Kindred warriors demand compensation from the governments of Earth--the right to call brides from among our world's population. Having no choice (the Scourge are still out there) Earth agrees. A type of draft is set up and every unmarried woman between the ages of nineteen and thirty-five is required to register. The chances of winning this &quot;bed-an-alien&quot; contest are about the same as winning the lottery--very rare--but it does happen on a regular basis. Before calling his bride, a Kindred warrior will become aligned with her and they will dream-share--or see each other's memories and daily activities in dreams regularly.Women who are drafted are required to go up to the Kindred Mothership and spend a thirty day &quot;claiming period&quot; with the warrior who has chosen them. If, at the end of that time, they have managed to resist the charms of their Kindred mate, they are allowed to go back down to Earth and resume their normal life. However, if they succumb to their Kindred male's seduction, they are mated for life and must move to the Kindred ship to live, leaving everything else behind and seeing their family and friends on Earth only infrequently. And the Kindred have a secret weapon--devotion to their female's pleasure and attention to detail during incredibly hot sex.&#xA0;The Rules of the Claiming PeriodThe Claiming Period lasts for four weeks:The Holding Week:the Kindred warrior may hold his bride onlyThe Bathing Week:the warrior and his bride bathe together and he is allowed to&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; massage her with scented oils.The Tasting Week:the warrior is allowed to perform oral sex on his bride.The Bonding Week:sex is allowed but it is completely up to the bride whether she will take things a step further and allow bonding sex which is a special and specific process to the three different types of Kindred males. &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; The only way out before the claiming period is up is a breach of contract. This can happen if the Kindred warrior does not strictly follow the rules and tries to skip forward in the order of allowed events or by breaking one of the rules laid down by the Kindred High Council. These rules--mostly to do with restrictions on communication with Earth--are for the safety of everyone aboard the Mothership and are nonnegotiable. &#xA0;&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;BairdHero of Book 1ClaimedBaird is a Beast Kindred, a native of Rageron. His father is one of the rare purebred Kindred whose bloodline has never mingled in a trade before so he has all the characteristics of his home planet. At six foot seven with black hair and golden eyes Baird is nobody to mess with and he has just been through a horrific ordeal. Captured and held by the Scourge he has been tortured by the evil AllFather who had a special affinity for the taste of his psychic pain. Throughout this ordeal, only one thing has kept Baird sane--the alignment of his mind with that of his bride's. When he escapes the Scourge Fathership his goal is to claim her without delay. &#xA0;&#xA0;Olivia Waterhouse (Liv)Heroine of Book 1Claimed&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Olivia is in her mid twenties and has just graduated from nursing school. She lives in Tampa, Florida with her best friend and twin sister, Sophia and their good friend Kat.&#xA0;Liv is stubborn, intelligent, and not afraid to stand up for herself. &#xA0;With her nursing degree in hand and the rest of her life ahead of her she would be feeling great about life if she hadn't started having such dark, disturbing dreams which all center on a man with black hair and golden eyes. She has no idea what the dreams mean but when two hulking envoys from the Human/Kindred Relations bureau show up on her front step to collect her, she begins to get the picture.Not being the type to go quietly, Liv fights the process of her claiming every step of the way. Though she is required by law to go aboard the Kindred Mothership and spend the thirty day claiming period with Baird, she makes no secret of the fact that she fully intends to wind up back on Earth living her normal life at the end of that time. Of course, Baird is just as determined to keep her as his wife.&#xA0;SylvanHero of Book 2Hunted&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Sylvan is a Blood Kindred, a native of Tranq Prime and Baird's half brother. He is built along the same massive lines as all Kindred warriors and has the blond hair and ice blue eyes of his people. He also has the cold, logical demeanor all Tranqs possess. But despite his icy exterior, Sylvan has been hurt in the past. After suffering a devastating rejection on Tranq Prime, he has vowed never to take a bride and no woman can move him. Until he meets Olivia's twin sister, Sophia, that is. Then, much to his chagrin, his mating instincts roar to life and he has to remind himself constantly that she is off limits.&#xA0;Sophia (Sophie)Heroine of Book 2Hunted&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Despite their shared looks, Sophie is Liv's polar opposite. She's shy and gentle but not weak though it takes her a little time to learn to stand up for herself. She's a first grade teacher and an artist who loves to paint. She's also fiercely loyal to her twin and horrified when Liv is taken away to the Kindred Mothership. Her antipathy toward Baird, who she sees as her sister's kidnapper, extends to Sylvan as well so their relationship is stormy right from the start.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Though she dislikes Sylvan, Sophie can't help the way her body responds to him. She tries to avoid him but inHunted&#xA0;their ship is forced down in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains while trying to return from the Kindred Mothership to Earth.

The short answer is no, it's not a real story. However, the story was inspired by events that occurred as I was growing up as a missionary kid in Asia. There were instances of kidnappings of missionaries throughout my growing up years. One had endings that was sad--the missionary kidnapped was killed. Another had an unknown ending--3 missionary men were eventually declared dead after 8 years based on reports although their bodies were never recovered. And yet another had a happy ending--the missionary was released after 810 days in captivity. It was those events that inspired me to writeFaith, Hope & Love. Also in my mind was the knowledge that many (all?)of us struggle at times with wondering where God is when things are rough. Or wondering what the bigger picture is when our view of our circumstances is so narrow. There are situations where we never do see the bigger picture, the impact our struggle may have had one others. But through it all, God remains faithful. We just have to keep our trust in Him.

Since publishing ANGELS over a year ago, I've&#xa0; been thrilled with the response I've gotten about that novel and its sequel, SINS OF THE FATHER. One of the greatest joys for me has been how well-received the characters have been, as they are all near and dear to my heart.When I set out to write SOUTHERN CROSS, I had a loose idea of what I wanted: I knew it would take place in Kentucky;&#xa0;I knew Diggs' past would figure significantly into unfolding events; and I knew that key elements of the conspiracy involving Erin's father would come to light. Beyond that, however, the entire novel was a mystery to me. I'm thrilled with what ultimately landed on the page, as I think it provides compelling background for readers looking for additional insight into the Diggs and Solomon dynamic, gives some tantalizing new information about the conspiracy, and -- most surprisingly for me -- shows a whole new side of Erin, as she struggles to come to terms with the violence she's encountered in the previous novels.I love watching these characters as they evolve, and their relationships deepen and change over time.

The St. Charles Players, composed of four actors, play a variety of roles with hammy gusto, although the dialogue is a bit rushed in the opening sections. This adaptation by Jeff Rack does a good job of capturing the feel of Verne's sprawling epic tale. The story is told by Professor Aronnax, who agrees to investigate a series of attacks by a mysterious sea monster. He joins the crew of the ship Abraham Lincoln. The men encounter what they believe is the monster, but turns out to be a large, state-of-the-art submarine, the Nautilus. Aronnax and a hot tempered harpoonist, Ned Land, are imprisoned on this vessel, captained by the misanthropic recluse, Nemo. Nemo takes them around the world. Verne's descriptions of the underwater world, with its exotic creatures and sunken ships, shine thanks to clear narration and evocative sound effects. As the journey continues, becoming monotonous, the program's midsection sags a bit. It picks up steam again with sequences involving a monstrous octopus and a storm.

Seeming to come from out of nowhere, he writes with the kind of assured, lyrical style that makes other writers salivate. Count me as one of them. He knows what makes a story tick. He knows the value of character. And he knows how to scare you. And he does it all like someone who has been writing since before King was King.

I'm Anne and I have a new life.I traded in a traditional career for a new life as an outdoor photographer and writer. I live in an RV and travel around North America photographing beautiful places. I write about travel, photography, and how changing your life is not as scary as it seems.When I first started photographing 20 years ago I lived in a darkness. My images were journalistic in style and focussed on problems in the world, sad stories, homeless people and I even had a whole series on graveyards. It is as if I lived in a world full of only bad things.I gave up photography for a long time as I focussed on my first career in software development and when I picked up a camera again my view of life began to change. By nature, I see all the negative things in the world. That comes easy. I have to put effort into seeing the good so I made a decision to only photograph beautiful things.Using photography to guide what I focus on every day is changing my outlook on life. Now I see the goodness and beauty in the world and it makes me a happier person.Two years ago I took another leap. I gave up my home in Victoria, BC, Canada, closed my software consulting business, bought an RV and hit the road for the life of a nomadic photographer. I wanted a happier more fulfilling life. I wanted the life I dreamed about. People tell me I am brave and they wish they could do what I did. For me, it felt like the only option that was right and good.I hope my story and images will inspire other people to change the way they view the world and the way they live their lives. Changing your life is not as difficult or scary as it seems! What is scary is not doing it.Today I am a successful photographer, author and teacher.

In this chilling one-off, the writing duo has had some twisted fun with the childhood of their beloved recurring character FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast. In the New Orleans of the agent's youth, kids didn't put baby teeth under their pillow in exchange for the tooth fairy's coin. Instead, they dropped them into a copper pot on an old man's front porch during a full moon. No one wanted to find out what happened if they didn't give the spooky tooth fairy of the French Quarter &#x22;his due.&#x22; All they knew was that the old man had to be appeased, according to legend. But when Pendergasts's younger brother, Diogenes, tries to pay his due with a baby tooth, Aloysius thinks his brother is being silly, and decides to intervene--to his regret.

He was born in London, the son of architect James Thomas Knowles and himself trained in architecture at University College and in Italy. He designed, amongst other buildings, three churches in Clapham, Lord Tennyson's house at Aldworth, the Thatched House Club, the Leicester Square garden (as restored at the expense of Baron Albert Grant), and Albert Mansions, Victoria Street, Westminster.[1] However, his preferences led him simultaneously into a literary career. In 1860 he published The Story of King Arthur. In 1866 he was introduced to Alfred Lord Tennyson and later agreed to design his new house, Aldworth, on condition there was no fee; this led to a close friendship, Knowles assisting Tennyson in business matters and, among other things, helping to design scenery for The Cup when Henry Irving produced that play in 1880. Knowles became intimate with a number of the most interesting men of the day, and in 1869, with Tennyson's cooperation, he founded the Metaphysical Society, the object of which was to attempt some intellectual rapprochement between religion and science by getting the leading representatives of faith and unfaith to meet and exchange views. Members included Tennyson, Gladstone, W.K.Clifford, W. G. Ward, John Morley, Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Thomson, T. H. Huxley, Arthur Balfour, Leslie Stephen, and Sir William Gull.[1] The society formed the nucleus of the distinguished list of contributors who supported Knowles in his capacity as an editor. In 1870 he succeeded Dean Alford as editor of the Contemporary Review, but left it in 1877 owing to the objection of the proprietors to the insertion of articles (by W.K.Clifford notably) attacking Theism and founded the Nineteenth Century (to the title of which, in 1901, were added the words And After). Both periodicals became very influential under him, and formed the type of the new sort of monthly review which came to occupy the place formerly held by the quarterlies. Inter alia it was prominent in checking the Channel Tunnel project, by publishing a protest signed by many distinguished men in 1882. In 1904 he received the honour of knighthood. He was a considerable collector of works of art. He was married twice,  in 1860 to Jane Borradaile,  in 1865 to Isabel Hewlett. He died at Brighton and was buried at the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.": {"frequency": 141, "value": "Sir James Knowles ..."}, "&#x22;Why School?

He hopes to enter the Planet's Funniest Kid Comic Contest even though just the thought of it makes him a nervous wreck. Readers learn that humor for Jamie is a means of survival-things aren't easy for him. He doesn't like to talk about why it all happened, but he had to move to a new city, to live with &#x22;the Smileys,&#x22; his very unfunny aunt and uncle. At Long Beach Middle School, he is treated horribly by the resident bully. Steve Kosgrov is not only a notorious meany, but is also Jamie's new adoptive brother. Steve gets his kicks by locking him out in the cold and leaving him stuck in a sand dune unable to move. Jamie isn't able to move because he uses a wheelchair-he can't walk at all. The grimness of his situation is relieved by two good buddies, his encouraging Uncle Frankie, and his ever-present ability to see humor in every situation. Patterson's tale includes twists and turns that make for an engrossing read.

E.L. James and Sylvia Day have done so much for the erotic romance genre and I do want to tip my hat to those authors. Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You have blazed a trail. Thank you, E.L. James and Sylvia Day from this author and all those who follow in your amazing footsteps.***About Knowing his Secret (Year of the Billionaire Vol. #1)I've always loved acting. I drew on my experiences in amateur theater for the setting where Tristan and Raina meet. A lot of people are surprised at how much talent can be found in Little Theaters. Even though folks don't get paid, they put a lot of effort and time into these productions. I thought that the setting would be a good way to keep the characters together without having them actuallyworktogether. For me, the apprentice and the big powerful boss is a plot line that's getting a bit worn.In creating the characters for Knowing his Secret, I wanted to craft believable people. I didn't want to take a cookie cutter image of a dominant billionaire and an innocent young woman. Tristan has his warts (of course, not the physical kind) and Raina is no pushover. As the series progresses, there is a subtle shift in the power dynamic. Even though the characters are larger than life, I wanted to reflect the kind of changes that naturally take place in a relationship over time.Attention to detail is one of my obsessions. I probably don't need to do as much research as I do for my books, but I want to make sure that you can get from point A to point B in fifteen minutes if I say you can.

What made this dream special was the fact it had a beginning, middle,\nand end and played out like a movie in my head. While I normally have vivid\ndreams, this was the first &quot;fantasy&quot; type. When I woke, I knew I had to write\nit down. First I relayed the dream to my husband, who listened or at least\npretended to listen. Then I began the process of writing. I had already\ncompleted two other books from a completely different genre, so writing wasn't\nforeign. After four intense days seated in front of my computer, I had the gist\nof the story saved. Another two years would pass before anyone other than my\nfamily and friends would read the story.I tried the traditional route of seeking an agent\nand/or publisher to take on my work, but like so many other authors, I found no\nsuccess. I'd located a few online sites that offered free reads, so in February\n2011, I decided I'd upload my book in an effort to get third party, unbiased\nfeedback on my writing. Initially the book was well received. I felt it was\ntime to move up to bigger platforms, all along thinking if the book received\nenough positive ratings, maybe an agent would be interested in representing me.In May 2011, I uploaded to a different book site that\nallowed me to price my book as free.I uploadedA\nDiamond in My Pocketto Amazon in August 2011 as a $0.99 book because\nAmazon didn't allow free listings. What I didn't know was Amazon would\nprice-match the competitors' prices. This caused my new listing to be dropped\nto free, which in turn caused my book to be listed on many &quot;free&quot; lists across\nthe Internet.Pocket'srank improved\ndramatically and reviews started coming in--reviews pointing out the flaws of\nthe manuscript. Finally I had my third party, unbiased feedback. Unfortunately\nthose reviews are still among the reviews on this book. When the price of the\nbook went back to ninety-nine cents, the downloads were still coming in.A Diamond in My Pocketsoared up the\ncharts, hitting the Movers&Shakers; list.Even though I'd received some bad reviews, most of\nthe reviews were positive and motivating. I continued to write on the series,\nreleasing book two,A Diamond in My Heart,in January 2012. Book three,The Diamond\nof Freedom,released in April 2013, and book four,The Diamond Bearers' Destiny,released December 2013. The books\nhave been edited many times over in an effort to give you the reader the best\npossible experience.Even without professional editing,A Diamond in My Pockethit the B&N;\nTeen Bestseller list in May 2012, was named Breakout Book by Apple's iBookstore\nin Feb 2013.A Diamond in My Heartbecame a #1 Amazon Bestseller in February 2014. All four books of The Unaltered\nSeries are nowInternational Bestsellersin the United States, U.K., and India.I will be writing more books in The Unaltered\nSeries, even though I'd stated earlier book four was the final installment. I'm\ncurrently working on getting the series into print form. I'm immensely grateful\nfor my readers who have been able to enjoy the story within my words. Even more\nso, I'm grateful to the readers who have shared my books with their friends,\nteachers, and through social media. However, without platforms like Amazon, allowing Indie authors like me the opportunity to succeed as writers, my books\nwould still be camped out on my computer, waiting for an agent to request a\npartial or full manuscript.Thanks for your interest in my &quot;author's story.&quot; I\nhope you enjoyA Diamond in My Pocketand the rest of The Unaltered Series.\nPlease visit my website lorenaangell.com and use the Contact Me form to let me\nknow what you think of my book.&#xa0;~Lorena\nAngell": {"frequency": 303, "value": "A Diamond in My ..."}, "Jill Paterson was born in Yorkshire, UK, and grew up in Adelaide, South Australia before spending 11 years in Ontario, Canada.

I had written a Special Forces series already (another future series), but never a spy or secret agent novel.I didn't want to write just another spy novel, though. That had been done and redone, so I thought, if I couldn't write something unique, I wouldn't write one at all. And in the spirit of L'Amour, I asked myself, if L'Amour were to write an out and out spy thriller, what would it be like? My answer? All action!I've taken my thrill for action, tied it together with tension, and carried the plot through to a climactic ending. That first spy thriller became Dark Liaison, A Christian Suspense Novel.That's the short version. So, here's the rest of the story of just how my first two novels in the COIL Series came about.If you want to hear the truth, Dark Liaison was probably the most agonizing writing project I've ever encountered. My editor would certainly agree. The action/adventure/espionage manuscript was first written by hand, as I usually do with my first drafts.&#xa0;The initial Dark Liaison manuscript took only a few weeks once my research was complete. But it seemed too short at only two hundred and some pages. So I tied in a whole second conflict with the same villain from part I to make the novel longer. Inside two months of hand-cramped scribbling, I had close to six hundred pages of international spy action.However, my editor took one look at it and said it was too long for today's market and for a first book. She suggested I cut it in half to make two novels rather than chop its content to a shorter length. Thus, the first two novels of the COIL series (Dark Liaison and Dark Hearted) were born.And after two years of drafts, edits, rewrites, new beginnings, new endings, a dozen field tests, more tweaks, and a lot of prayer, I excitedly say . . . ebook readers, here we come!It's a lot of work to write a novel, but very rewarding. I hope you enjoy this book. I'd love to hear your thoughts on it when you are finished.-- David Telbat": {"frequency": 134, "value": "Here are the short ..."}, "Sherri Rae Rasmussen, a 29-year-old newlywed, was murdered in her Los Angeles condo. Homicide detectives advanced a theory that the murder was a botched burglary, but that theory was wildly incongruous with the crime-scene evidence, which pointed to an execution-style murder. When a new detective reinvestigates the murder more than 20 years later, alarming details come to light, forcing police to take the utmost precautions when arresting the killer. This Kindle Single, which reads like a thriller/police procedural neatly wrapped in tight journalistic prose, pieces together the case's facts and deliberate deceptions.

That couldn't be her escort.WHEEEET! A second call echoed the first, turning the heads of passengers boarding and disembarking from the train.Opal Bright shaded her eyes with one gloved hand, her other balancing a large hatbox against her hip.&#xa0;Surely the dust-covered man a head taller than those around him wasn't her father's chosen emissary.But when he waved his once-white Stetson above his head and began shouldering his way across the crowded train platform, Opal's hopes plummeted.&#x22;Miss Opal? Opal Bright? Your father sent me. I'm his foreman, Charlie Welch.&#x22;She tried to keep her lips from pinching as she considered the man, from the tips of his mud-covered boots to his patched and frayed woolen shirt to his warm, brown eyes and half-smile. She failed.Mostly because she was irritated at having to wait so long. It was another sign how little she mattered to her father.&#x22;You're over an hour late. And how dare you-you whistle at me as if I were a-a cattle dog to be called to your side!&#x22;His expression didn't change, except for a tiny quirk at one corner of his mouth. &#x22;Miss, I'm sure you'd like to get out of the warm sun for a bit.

Suddenly, he yanked her by the elbow, pushing through the crowd and taking her with him.&#x22;I'll thank you to unhand me.&#x22; She tried to wiggle her arm loose from his grasp, without success. Her hatbox bobbled and she nearly dropped it. An upset &#x22;mrrow&#x22; emerged from inside. A sound Opal hoped Charlie hadn't heard.The cowhand ignored her and bodily escorted her down the rough wooden steps from the platform to the dusty street below.&#xa0;&#x22;Let. Me. Go.&#x22; Opal yanked against his hold, but only succeeded in possibly giving herself bruises. His iron grip didn't slip.&#x22;There isn't any gold.&#x22; He spoke loudly, throwing the words over his shoulder. Almost as if he spoke to someone behind her.&#x22;But--&#x22; Opal gasped as he dragged her through a muddy spot between two buildings, ruining the hem of her traveling suit. The only nice gown she had left.&#x22;I don't know what you're talking about, but keep yer trap shut,&#x22; Charlie hissed, leaning close so she got a whiff of leather and soap and man. It was enough to make her shiver.&#x22;I'll thank you not to behave so familiarly,&#x22; she bit off, annoyed at her thundering heart. &#x22;You're entirely too close.&#x22;&#x22;Well, I'll thank you,&#x22; he mimicked her with a wrinkle of his nose, &#x22;not to make such a fool announcement in front of God and ever'body.

Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locations&#xa0;of&#xa0;a world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 1998, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carved&#xa0;time&#xa0;out of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict.

By tracking the unlikely, decades-long journey of an eccentric photographer's left-behind portraits, Julia Scully achieves something magical: not only does she bring small-town photographer Mike Disfarmer to life, but she also gives life to the rural Arkansans--farmers and soldiers, sweethearts and newlyweds, babies and grandparents--whose honest faces inhabit those once abandoned negatives. When Disfarmer died in 1959, his negatives were sold for $5, then were left moldering in a carport until a newspaper photographer discovered them in the 1970s. As editor ofModern Photographymagazine at the time, Scully played a key role in championing the intimate beauty of Disfarmer's work, which captured both the poverty and stoic resilience of his subjects, most of them residents of Heber Springs, Arkansas. (See for yourself at disfarmer.com.) Scully helped publish a book about Disfarmer in 1976, which prompted comparisons to Diane Arbus and Richard Avedon. The New York Times called Disfarmer's work &#x22;an outstanding discovery&#x22; and he has since become the subject of books, films, and exhibitions, his black and white mini-masterpieces selling for thousands of dollars and hanging in New York City&#x2019;s MOMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

I did most of that in the aerospace field for MacDonnell Douglas Corp, in St. Louis, Mo. I worked on the F4 Phantom project, and briefly on Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), before the fickle fates of government finance forced contract cancelations. I devoted (read: I was drafted into) two years' service for the US Army from 1965 to 1967. A great two years, and the Army, caring not a whit for my electronics background, offered this draftee a job as an Air Traffic Controller. Cool! After discharge I spent a short time back at MacDonnell Douglas before the contract reductions laid me off, and was hired by Emerson Electric (1968), working on the design of a neat heads-up fire control system for the Army's new Cheyenne Helicopter (to be a 270-knot hybrid fixed wing/rotor craft). Never heard of it? The fickle fates of Army finance is why this time, plus Lockheed didn't keep the airframe part from crashing and burning at a crucial point in development. I taught Electronics for about eighteen months (near starvation wages after the high pay), and finally decided to try my hand at actually supporting my family again. I hired on with the Federal Aviation Administration as an Air Traffic Controller in 1970. Thanks Army! I spent exactly forty years in federal service, deciding in 1979 to use my technical background to work on writing features for the software of the FAA's Terminal Automation Systems (for 28 of those 40 years). Retired, I now work as a consultant/contractor for the FAA, supporting a software feature I helped create. I finally decided to try my hand at writing what I love to read, Science Fiction. My Koban series is doing very well. I hope you enjoy the books.

A man driving a black Mercedes convertible was in traffic next to me, and on his Massachusetts license plate were his initials plus MD. I wondered where the handsome doctor could be going. The Fall is my answer to that question. As I developed the character of Ted, a pediatric oncologist, I realized I needed some day-in-the-life details to make his character more authentic. During an Internet search, I discovered a blog by Dr. Samuel Blackman, at the time a pediatric oncologist at Children's Hospital Boston. The similarities between Sam's story and the back story I had already given Ted were startling, to say the least. Sam generously allowed me to borrow anecdotes from his blog that added so much to this story. For that as well as his friendship and support, I'm truly grateful.Thank you Christina Camara, Julie Cupp, Paula Del Bonis-Platt and Lisa Ridder, who read the early drafts and provided invaluable feedback.

From adolescence to adulthood, his imagination continued to feed itself on a diet of books, movies, and art, all the while growing and maturing--waiting for its opportunity. Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locations of a world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 2008, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carved time out of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict.

His books have hit the NY Times, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal and numerous other bestseller lists. His book The Jefferson Allegiance, was released independently and reached #2 overall in sales on Nook. Bob Mayer grew up in the Bronx. After high school, he entered West Point where he learned about the history of our military and our country. During his four years at the Academy and later in the Infantry, Mayer questioned the idea of &#x22;mission over men.&#x22; When he volunteered and passed selection for the Special Forces as a Green Beret, he felt more at ease where the men were more important than the mission. Mayer's obsession with mythology and his vast knowledge of the military and Special Forces, mixed with his strong desire to learn from history, is the foundation for his science fiction series Atlantis, Area 51 and Psychic Warrior. Mayer is a master at blending elements of truth into all of his thrillers, leaving the reader questioning what is real and what isn't. He took this same passion and created thrillers based in fact and riddled with possibilities. His unique background in the Special Forces gives the reader a sense of authenticity and creates a reality that makes the reader wonder where fact ends and fiction begins. In his historical fiction novels, Mayer blends actual events with fictional characters. He doesn't change history, but instead changes how history came into being.

From adolescence to adulthood, his imagination continued to feed itself on a diet of books, movies, and art, all the while growing and maturing--waiting for its opportunity. Then, during a procession of monotonous, physically laborious day-jobs, his imagination leaped into motion, bringing together characters and locationsofa world that would someday come to life on the pages of a book. In late 1998, Jason made his first attempt at writing, managing to complete a whole scene before returning once again to reality. A year and a half later, a spontaneous night-time conversation with his wife encouraged him to take his writing seriously and to keep on dreaming. Over the next seven years, Jason carvedtimeout of the real world to live in an imaginary one of epic fantasy, science-fiction, and military/political conflict. The fruits of this labor would later become the first three books of the bestselling AWAKENED series. Due to the overwhelming support of readers around the world, Jason has continued his trajectory into make-believe, recently jumping from stable employment in the micro-electronics industry into the mysterious abyss of full-time writing. Living in Colorado with his beautiful wife and two children, Jason now spends the majority of his time fusing the best parts of his favorite genres into stories of internal struggle and triumph, friendship, betrayal, political alliances, and military conflict.

It deserves to be read - not simply because it is the basis for symbols so deeply ingrained in American culture that we no longer realize their source, nor because it is one of the bestselling books of all time. This is a book that changed history. Harriet Beecher Stowe was appalled by slavery, and she took one of the few options open to nineteenth century women who wanted to affect public opinion: she wrote a novel, a huge, enthralling narrative that claimed the heart, soul, and politics of pre-Civil War Americans. It is unabashed propaganda and overtly moralistic, an attempt to make whites - North and South - see slaves as mothers, fathers, and people with (Christian) souls. In a time when women might see the majority of their children die, Harriet Beecher Stowe portrays beautiful Eliza fleeing slavery to protect her son. In a time when many whites claimed slavery had &#34;good effects&#34; on blacks,Uncle Tom's Cabinpaints pictures of three plantations, each worse than the other, where even the best plantation leaves a slave at the mercy of fate or debt. By twentieth-century standards, her propaganda verges on melodrama, and it is clear that even while arguing for the abolition of slavery she did not rise above her own racism. Yet her questions remain penetrating even today: &#34;Is man ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? --review by Erica Bauermeister": {"frequency": 659, "value": "This is one of ..."}, "&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;From a TOP 500 REVIEWER:It has a really great pace to\nit, and I felt that the story was quite believable throughout.
